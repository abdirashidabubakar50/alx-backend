### PAGINATION

 - Most endpoints that returns a list of entities will need to have some sort of pagination..
 - Paging requires an implied ordering.

 <!-- ## 1. Offset pagination
  - This is the simplest of paging. limit/offset paging would look like `GET /items?limit=20&offset=100` - This query would return the 20 rows starting with the 100th row.
